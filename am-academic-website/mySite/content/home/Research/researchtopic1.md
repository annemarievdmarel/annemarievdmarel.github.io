Species have to navigate both the physical and social environment in order to survive and attain fitness benefits. Yet, in a changing environment, it may be difficult for species to adjust. Disturbances or perturbations may differentially affect a populationâ€™s ability to cope with this change, i.e., resilience. Biological systems, such as ecosystems and social systems, are often resilient. Thus, although individual components have disappeared, the system is able to recover. But how species can cope with the change is not clear. I am interested in getting a better understanding of social evolution and in identifying the mechanisms for species to cope with changing social environments.
