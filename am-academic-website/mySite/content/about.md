I am originally from The Netherlands, traveled to Canada to pursue my PhD, finished a postdoc in the US and I'm currently in Chile for a postdoctoral fellowship. I'm curious where my academic career will take me next!  

In my spare time, I like to climb, hike, canoe, or do any other outdoor adventure with my husband.

### About me

Currently, I am a FONDECYT postdoc fellow with Dr. Luis Ebensperger at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile studying the role individual degus play within their social groups. I finished a postdoc in Dr. Liz Hobson’s lab at the University of Cincinnati, USA, studying aggression and social information in monk parakeets. I obtained my Ph.D. in Biological Sciences from the University of Manitoba, Canada, where I studied the life history traits, the social system and anti-predator behavior in a non-endemic island population of Barbary ground squirrels on Fuerteventura, Spain. I obtained a Master of Science degree in behavioural ecology from the University of Utrecht, The Netherlands, where I studied individual differences in behavior in relation to survival and reproductive success using different study systems. For more details see the ‘research’ page.

### Skills

My research uses an integrative approach of behavioural, empirical, comparative, and computational studies to better understand social evolution. I combine both field-based observational and manipulative experiments, such as radio telemetry, acoustic analysis, personality experiments, with laboratory approaches, such as genetic analysis, to gain an understanding of the selective pressures and constraints that influence social behaviour and to study how animals can adapt to changing environments. I perform my statistical analyses in R and describe interaction patterns at multiple social scales (individual, group, and population-level) using social network analysis which provides us the opportunity to study resilience.
